# Customer Personality Analysis
This is an SQL analysis project that uses the ['marketing campaign'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/marketing_campaign.csv) to clean the data and identify trends and insights based on this data.
# Project Description
In this project, I attempted to convert a poorly formatted CSV file into a more easily workable format, then I used SQL to clean the data by removing duplicates and unnecessary columns, and to transform the data in order to identify interesting insights.
